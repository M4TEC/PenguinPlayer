A simple player based on Netease Cloud Music, and it only needs to load ONE JavaScript file!

## Usage
First, download the [latest release](https://github.com/M4TEC/PenguinPlayer/releases/latest/download/player.js) of ```player.js``` from Releases.

Now, set your playlist ID by setting ```penguin_id``` in ```window``` context, for example ```window.penguin_id = "440401494"```.

Then just include ```player.js``` inside your page!
